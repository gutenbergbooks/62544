<h2 class="gesp2">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The aim of this booklet is to present to the
eye-specialist, the teacher, the student, and
others interested in the study of the anatomy
and physiology of the eye, some definite methods
to follow in the dissection of that organ.</p>

<p>Most dissections of the eye are not made
with the same degree of care and skill used in
the dissections of other organs. In following
the usual method of dissecting eyes, much
of the important detail is lost. Often certain
membranes are confounded with others, and
wrongly demonstrated. Furthermore, an eye
is merely divided by some demonstrators into
an anterior and a posterior half, a very short
time is spent by the students scrutinizing each
half; then the text-book is turned to, and the
anatomy is studied descriptively.</p>

<p>Not enough time has been given to thoroughly
dissecting all parts of the eye. As much
time should be given as is necessary to bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
out prominently all its parts. Other organs of
the body are more thoroughly dissected, and,
therefore, the student has better opportunity
to gain a clearer comprehension and better understanding
of the anatomy and physiology of
those organs. Also, as much time should be
given, proportionately, to the learning of the
technique of the dissection of the eye as is
given to the learning of the technique of dissecting
other organs of the body.</p>

<p>Many now make a direct specialty of ministering
to those suffering from errors of ocular
refraction, ocular diseases, and ocular reflexes,
and for those specialists, principally, this book
is written. It is to fulfil its mission to them by
acting as a guide and as a complement to the
descriptive matter in the text-book. It is sent
forth in the hope that it will tend to create
more interest in the study of the practical
anatomy of the eye. It is written with a desire
to stimulate the ability to make careful
and intelligent observation. It carries with it,
as a final end, an earnest wish that it may, in
some small way, be the means of opening up<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
to the original researcher, a larger field for
the further study of the most important of the
senses&mdash;the eyesight.</p>

<p>Most of the dissections explained in the following
pages are original; some, however, are
only revisions of old methods.</p>

<p>This opportunity is taken to acknowledge
the many helpful suggestions that were made
by Dr. Ivin Sickels, of the College of the City
of New York, and by the late Dr. Edward C.
Spitzka, of New York. Thanks are due Mr.
E. F. Howes, of Messrs. Swift &amp; Co., for furnishing
the necessary supply of beef eyes;
to Messrs. Lee &amp; Beach, photographers, of
New York, for their painstaking efforts in producing
good photographs of the actual dissections;
and to Schlueter Printing Company, of
New York, for their many courtesies and interest
in the production of the book.</p>

<h2 class="gesp2">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>In eye dissections it is unnecessary to have
either a large equipment of instruments or
a special room. To have a laboratory at
one&#8217;s disposal is but a small added convenience.
Not to have it, is no serious hindrance.
The work may be carried on and successfully
done in one&#8217;s office or in the home, as well as
in class-room or laboratory. If it is true that
the atmosphere of a laboratory adds zeal to
the efforts of a worker, but there is no laboratory
available, then reverse the order; let the
zeal of the worker add to the atmosphere of
the place in which he is doing his work.</p>

<p>Two things, among others to be mentioned
later, are essential; a table of convenient
height, and a good light, natural or artificial.
Both are but modest needs. Compared with
other dissections, there will be found an absence
of offensive odors. Neither are there
any repulsive sensations experienced. Such
experiences are quite common when making<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
other kinds of dissections. This work is
clean and attractive. Indeed, one may even
develop a rather keen sense of the &aelig;sthetic.
Many of the various parts of the eye, when
separated and properly preserved, then viewed
and inspected, are bound to bring forth exclamations
of appreciation and wonderment.
One can then better understand the statement:
&#8220;When Nature perfected the first eye
she took a day off so she could admire the result
of her finest piece of handiwork.&#8221;</p>

<p>This does not imply that dissections of the
eye tend to develop art appreciation. Appreciation
of the wonderful in Nature&#8217;s construction
of the special organs is not, however, to
be relegated to a distant point. Such appreciation
is concomitant with the knowledge
that comes from having seen, handled, and
examined the object studied.</p>

<p>The orchestra leader must have a good listening
and hearing ear. This is developed in
him because he has to exercise constantly his
power of listening and hearing. The dissector
who would become proficient in eye dissections<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
and in anatomical investigations must have a
good seeing eye and a dextrous hand. To acquire
these two most valuable aids necessary
to carry on careful inquiry or research, it is
essential to practise using the eye and the
hand. Combined with the expertness of these
two, must be the ability to continue one&#8217;s efforts
in the face of failure; to redouble one&#8217;s
efforts to attain success despite the shortcomings
of eye or hand. This simply means
practise and patience. And the one who is
without that wonderful virtue, patience, will
never stay long enough with his problem to
gain either an observing eye or an expert
hand, or to achieve his end, and thereby reap
the full and pleasing results of his efforts. In
order of importance, patience really precedes
dexterity, skill, and observation; and persistence
of effort is a factor not to be entirely
outshone by any other virtue. With these attributes,
knowledge of the subject in hand
naturally follows.</p>

<p>One reason why eye dissections are easily
carried on is because material can always be<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
readily procured. Any butcher will furnish
sheep, pig, or beef eyes. Or, if one has the
time to visit the manager of a slaughter-house,
and make known to him one&#8217;s needs, he will
supply enough eyes to carry through a host
of interesting dissections and experiments, and
give sufficient material for careful, orderly,
and fruitful study. Perhaps in no other kinds
of dissections will the investigator find so
much of interest, or have his efforts crowned
with such abundant and satisfactory results,
as in the dissections of the eye. But no one
should try to study all parts of the eye with
only one specimen. To try to do so is an error,
and a common one often committed by both
teachers and students. Specimens cost little
or nothing, and it is no more trouble to prepare
a half-dozen eyes for dissection than one.
The cost of preparation, too, is but little more
for a number of eyes than it is for one, and
may be no more in some instances. Besides,
having enough material on hand saves time in
case of a failure. Also, one can quickly repeat
a dissection, and so procure any number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span>
desired specimens of specific parts, or do over
again the same dissection on another eye just
for the purpose of practise, and thus add to
one&#8217;s dexterity. It is, therefore, strongly advocated
to have plenty of material on hand before
beginning work. Economy here is not
even &#8220;penny wise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tools, or instruments, needed are but
few in number; an ordinary scalpel, a pair of
blunt tweezers, or forceps, as they are sometimes
called; a pair of sharp-pointed tweezers,
a pair of small, sharp-pointed scissors of
about three to three and a half inches in
length, and a pair of large scissors, about
four or five inches in length, having one jaw
sharp-pointed and one jaw blunt.</p>

<p>For glassware, any wide-mouthed jar or
bottle, such as the ordinary fruit or jelly jar,
will do for preparing material. For clarifying
tissues, or for preserving and keeping them,
small, wide-mouthed bottles or vials should be
used. And for temporary keeping, or for
purposes of &#8220;running through&#8221; various fluids,
the regular Stender dishes are most convenient.<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
A glass graduate is almost indispensable
if accuracy in measuring fluids is desired.

<p>The chemicals needed are few in number
and small in quantity: Alcohols in varying
strength, which can be made by diluting a 95
per cent. alcohol, and keeping an absolute alcohol
on hand. A few ounces of formaldehyde
will make enough solutions of different
strengths to be sufficient for the preparation
and keeping of many specimens. Of other
chemicals, such as xylol and cedar oil, only
small quantities are needed; enough to cover<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
a specimen. Fifteen to twenty cents worth of
each will be an ample supply to keep on hand.
All of these may be procured at any large
drug store, and are the only chemicals required
for doing the dissections as explained
in this book.</p>

<p>Before further advance is made, it will be
best to state that this work deals only with
methods for dissecting the various parts of an
eye, and is primarily intended to aid in the
study of the anatomy and physiology of the
eye by being used in conjunction with such
books as &#8220;Gray&#8217;s Anatomy,&#8221; &#8220;A Text-Book
of Physiology,&#8221; by Howell, &#8220;The Anatomy
and the Physiology of the Eye,&#8221; by Brown and
Zoethout, and similar other works of authority.
However, if it is desired to acquire only specimens,
then, of course, no other works are
necessary, and the matter contained herein is
sufficient to enable one to procure just what is
wanted.</p>

<p>It is also wise to state here that since human
eyes are hard to procure, and not available
in large quantities, one must resort to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
use of the eyes of animals, which are procurable
in large quantities, and which may be
used without &#8220;feelings&#8221; in the matter.
Though there is a difference between the eyes
of human beings and the eyes of other animals,
the difference is slight and of minor importance
when compared with the similarity
of the more important parts.</p>

<h2>REMOVAL OF THE HYALOID MEMBRANE
WITH CONTENTS AND
ATTACHMENTS <span class="nowrap">INTACT<sup><a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1">[1]</a><a
id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2">[2]</a></sup></span></h2>

<p>One of the easiest and most satisfactory dissections
to attempt is the isolating of the hyaloid
membrane with its contents and its attachments.
The success one meets with in
making this dissection will surely prove a
strong incentive for making all the rest. For
these reasons this has been placed first in this
arrangement.</p>

<p>In eye dissections it is quite customary, in
giving directions for dissections, merely to<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
mention the hyaloid membrane and its relations
with other parts of the eye. Rarely is
there any attempt made to isolate it. Often,
too, the retina is mistaken for the hyaloid, and
the retina then wrongly demonstrated as
being attached to the choroid. Of course, it is
impossible to separate the hyaloid from the
vitreous; but a dissection can be made which,
when placed in a glass of some kind, will show
the hyaloid. If the following simple technique
is carefully observed, the membrane,
with all its connections, can be easily separated
from certain other parts of the eye.
Opportunity for thorough study and observation
will then be made extremely easy.</p>

<p>Procure the eye of either a sheep or a bullock.
Instead of following the usual procedure
of hardening in any one of the several solutions
used for the purpose of toughening the
ocular tissues, place the eye in a cool place
and permit it to collapse a trifle. Usually two
or three days is a sufficient length of time to
accomplish the result.</p>

<p>Experiments have shown that if an eye is<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
too fresh the ciliary processes will not be
easily detached from the hyaloid (zonular processes),
and if the eye has been in a preserving
fluid, the same result will follow. A
sheep&#8217;s eye will make a better specimen even if
it is small, because the ciliary processes are
more easily separated from the zonular processes.
If a bullock&#8217;s eye is used, it must be
left in a cool place a day or two longer than
in the case of a sheep&#8217;s eye, in order to permit
a long enough time to elapse to allow disintegration
of the eye to take place sufficient to
have the two processes separate easily and
cleanly.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>With a pair of dissecting forceps pinch up
the sclerotic about 5 mm. anterior to the equator.
With a pair of small, fine-pointed scissors,
make an incision. (<a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a>.) Next hold the
eye in the left hand without exerting any pressure.
Insert the point of the scissors into the
incision which has been made, and cut. Be
careful to keep the point of the scissors close
to the sclerotic or an untimely puncturing of
the choroid will occur. (<a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>.) Continue
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28-<br />29]<a id="Page29"></a></span>
cutting on a line parallel to the equatorial meridian
and about 5 mm. anterior to it until
about half the sclerotic has been separated.
In cutting, always move the point of the scissors
forward with a slight oscillating lateral
movement. (<a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4</a>.) While doing this, partly
suspend the eyeball from the point of the scissors.
Doing these things will tend to loosen<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
the choroid from the sclerotic and prevent
puncturing too soon the former mentioned
membrane. Now apply pressure in such a
manner that the lips of the cut sclerotic will
gap. Into this put the point of the scissors
and very carefully pick up the choroid and the
retina with the point of the scissors and cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
them. (<a href="#Fig5">Fig. 5</a>.) If the choroid alone has been
picked up and separated, the retina will show
milky white or yellowish white underneath.
The retina must then also be separated. Care
must be taken not to go deeper than the retina
or the hyaloid may be damaged. Continue the
cutting of the choroid and the retina for a
distance of about 20 mm. Apply enough pressure
occasionally so that the vitreous will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
forced upward and above the cut choroid and
the retina. This will show whether any
strands of the two membranes have been left
uncut. If the separation is complete for the
distance specified above, invert the eyeball,
squeeze and shake gently over some receptacle,
such as a Stender dish, three-fourths filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
with a 2½ or 5 per cent. solution of formaldehyde,
and the hyaloid membrane containing
the vitreous, its attachments, suspensory ligament
to the lens capsule, and lens, will drop
out intact, as when one empties the contents
of an egg. (<a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>.)</p>

<p>Many times a considerable amount of pigment
from the second tunic will remain attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
to the <i>processus zonuloe</i>. This pigment
may be easily removed by scraping it off
with the sharp edge of the scalpel or by
brushing it off with a soft, wet tooth-brush.</p>

<p>It is unwise to use alcohol as a preservative
because it produces an almost immediate
opaqueness and hardness which spoils the
specimen for further study.</p>

<p>This description may give the impression
that the dissection is a lengthy one; however,
it can be done by an expert in two or three
minutes; by a beginner in five or six minutes.</p>

<p>For purposes of demonstration or study the

<h2>THE CANAL OF PETIT</h2>

<p>The canal of Petit is a &#8220;triangular space
around the circumference of the lens.&#8221; That
it can be &#8220;inflated through a fine blowpipe inserted
through the suspensory ligament,&#8221; is
the usual direction given. However, the ordinary
&#8220;fine blowpipe&#8221; is much too large and
too dull to be inserted through the suspensory
ligament. Take a long medicine-dropper (5
or 10 cents at a drug store), or a pipette,
and heat it until it is red hot over an alcohol
lamp or a Bunsen burner; hold one end with
one hand and the other end with a pair of
tweezers. As the glass becomes white hot
pull the tube apart. This will leave the places
of separation pointed and sharp-edged. Use
the larger of the two pieces. Sometimes the
point or tapering end of the tube is too long
and the bore too small. All that is necessary
is to first mark off with a file the length to be
broken off, and then that length may be snapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
off, leaving a sharp-edged, tapering point.</p>

<p>After having completed the first dissection
(the hyaloid, contents and attachments), and
the specimen has been in the formaldehyde

the specimen has been kept in a large receptacle,
such, for instance, as a jar, remove it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>

so that the lens will be uppermost. Find the
suspensory ligament in the Zone of Zinn. Insert
the pointed end of the glass tube, close to
the lens, and blow gently until the canal shows
its sacculated construction by filling with air,
giving the appearance of a lot of little bubbles

<h2>THE INTERIOR OF THE EYE</h2>

<p>For the study of the interior of the eye and
its contents <i>in situ</i> either a fresh or a hardened
eye will do; a hardened eye is preferable.
In the dissection for isolating the hyaloid
membrane, vitreous, lens, and other parts,
the anterior and posterior halves of the evacuated
eye may be separated entirely, and each
half studied. However, the choroid and the
retina will be more or less mutilated, and the
vitreous and other parts will be removed. The
absence of these parts will prevent one from
receiving a definite idea of their anatomical
relationships. Therefore, it is better to work
with an entire and complete eye.</p>

sections with safety-razor blade.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Remove all the muscles and fatty tissues
from the outside of the globe; then cut it in
half through the equator, thus dividing it into
an anterior and a posterior half. The cutting
of the sclerotic, as well as the underlying tissues
and the vitreous, should be done with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
large scissors; using a knife or scalpel will
tend to disturb the positions of those tissues
or so tear them that they will not be of much
use for purposes of study. An ordinary safety-razor
blade makes an excellent instrument for
separating the eye into two halves, because it
cuts through the tissues without tearing them
in any way. (<a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a>.) The rather dark colored,<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
viscid fluid that escapes when the eye is
halved is the perichoroidal lymph, not the
aqueous, as is sometimes stated.</p>

<h3>THE POSTERIOR HALF</h3>

<p>The posterior half is taken first because it
is the simplest and easiest of the two halves
to dissect. In this half of the eye the retina
may be readily seen through the vitreous; the
choroid and its apparent iridescent colors
through both vitreous and retina. (<a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
Remove the vitreous by simply tilting this
half of the eye, and with the finger push out
the vitreous.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig10">

<img src="images/illo040.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="428" />

<p class="caption">Fig. 10&mdash;The retina, retinal vessels, and
iridescent choroid showing through
the vitreous.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Sometimes the vitreous will adhere very
closely to the retina. This occurs especially
when the eye has been in formaldehyde for a
long time. In such a case the removal of the
vitreous without injuring the retina requires
patience and care. The use of the scalpel and
the scissors may become necessary. Another
very good way to remove the vitreous is to
take hold of the sclerotic, turn it so that the vitreous
is downward, and then shake gently until
the vitreous separates itself from the retina
and, drops out. After the vitreous has been
removed, notice its glassy appearance; hence
its name&mdash;hyaloid body. Try to pull it apart
with the fingers, and it will be noticed that it
seems to be held together by more or less of a
network of fibres. (<a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig11">

<img src="images/illo042.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="551" />

<p class="caption">Fig. 11&mdash;Showing how vitreous seems to be held
together by a network of fibres. (Page 41.)</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Whichever method for removing the vitreous
is followed, the retina will be left rather badly
wrinkled and out of place. If the last-mentioned
method, which is really the best of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
three described, is the one adopted, the retina
will be left in an entirely collapsed and folded
form. In any case, to straighten out the retina
against the choroid, immerse the whole
posterior half in water, inside uppermost. The
retina will then slowly unfold itself and lie
flat against the choroid. With the tweezers remove<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
the whole half from the water; tilting it
slowly to empty it of all the water, and, having
done so, turn it down upon the table rather
forcibly in order to help it drain itself of all
the water.</p>

<p>Notice the thinness of the retina, and, also,
that the seeming iridescence of the choroid
shows through. The optic disc, which is the
point of entrance of the optic nerve, and the
optic cup are easily recognized, though neither
will be seen as large as when viewed in the
living eye with an ophthalmoscope. The
blood vessels of the retina, as they ramify
outward or forward, after their entrance
through the optic nerve through which they
pass, are also very plainly seen. A closer
inspection will show, in the very centre of
the &#8220;entrance&#8221; of the optic nerve, a whitish,
pointed vessel, about 1 or 2 mm. long.
That is the sloughed-off and atrophied end
of the hyaloid artery, which, when the eye
was in an embryonic state, ran forward from
the central artery of the retina through the
hyaloid canal to the posterior surface of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
lens. With the forceps pick up the peripheral
edge of the retina, and, by pulling gently upward,
tear it away from its apparent place of
attachment to the &#8220;entrance&#8221; of the optic
nerve. (<a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a>.) When this has been done,
there will be seen some threads protruding<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
from the optic nerve. Filling the half with
water will tend to separate these strands,
which are optic-nerve elements.</p>

<p>After the removal of the retina, the iridescence
of the choroid (<i>tapetum lucidum</i>)
(<a href="#Fig13">Fig. 13</a>) may be examined with a hand lens,
or, after its removal, a piece may be cut
and placed under a microscope. This iridescence
is, of course, not present in the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
eye. (&#8220;Physiology of the Senses,&#8221; McKendrick

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>After the choroid is removed, which is accomplished
in the same manner that the retina
is removed, the inner side of the sclerotic is
laid bare to view. The brownish color is
mostly due to the presence of a small amount
of pigment in the cells of one of the inner layers,
it is also due, to a slight extent, to the
staining influence of the perichoroidal fluid.
(<a href="#Fig14">Fig. 14</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span></p>

<h3>THE OPTIC NERVE</h3>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig15">

<img src="images/illo047.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="400" />

<p class="caption">Fig. 15&mdash;Enlarged to show the entrance of the optic
nerve. (<a href="#Page48">Page 48</a>.)</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The excavated posterior half may be used
now to show and to study the construction of
the optic nerve. In cutting the optic nerve
away from the sclerotic leave at least 5 mm. of
the sclerotic attached. It will make handling
easier. With the thumb and forefinger of the
left hand hold the nerve in such a way on the
table that it will be straightened out lengthwise,
and then, using the scalpel or a safety-razor<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
blade, the latter being preferable, cut the
nerve in two longitudinally. (<a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>.) The
cutting must be done with one movement,
otherwise the nerve will be hacked, and will
not make a good specimen. This specimen
will show the way the nerve fibers are arranged.
A cross section should be cut from
the optic nerve of another eye, and then the
two sections should be compared. The cross
section will show the sheath of the nerve a<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
little better than will the longitudinal section.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig16">

<img src="images/illo048.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="501" />

<p class="caption">Fig. 16&mdash;Showing ciliary processes
and crystalline lens.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>In cutting the longitudinal section, one is
sometimes so fortunate as to cut through the
central blood vessels of the retina. These vessels
will show up then as a rather thin dark
streak about 5 or 6 mm. long.</p>

<h3>THE ANTERIOR HALF</h3>

<p>The anterior half will show the lens <i>in situ</i>,
the ciliary processes, the posterior aspects of
the iris and the lens, the corona ciliaris, the
orbicularis ciliaris, and the ora serrata. (<a href="#Fig16">Fig.
16</a>.) If the eye has been cut in two too far
forward of its equator, the ora serrata will
not be present. The ciliary processes and posterior
aspect of the lens may be seen to better
advantage when the anterior half of the vitreous
is removed. This is done with the dull-pointed
tweezers, by catching hold of the vitreous
at any part of its free or cut margin, and
stripping it off both the ciliary processes and
the lens, using a prying, pulling movement to
do so. (<a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>.) The two layers of the pigment
cells, pars ciliaris retinae, which cover<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
the inner surface of the processes, may be removed
by picking them away carefully with
the tweezers. The processes then will be seen
to be a whitish color. The pupillary edge
of the iris rests upon the capsule of the lens,
but the nearer the approach is to the choroidal
edge the farther the iris is from the lens; thus
are formed the anterior and the posterior
chambers of the eye. The dissection of the
sagittal section of the eye, explained further<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
on, will show these two chambers in section.
One will gain a much clearer conception of
their construction in that section than in the
&#8220;anterior half&#8221; specimen.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig17">

<img src="images/illo050.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="444" />

<p class="caption">Fig. 17&mdash;Anterior half, showing how to pull off vitreous.
(<a href="#Page49">Page 49</a>.)</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Now, remove the lens, using the point of
the scalpel to cut through the suspensory ligament
close to the lens. When this has been
done there will be seen in the anterior chamber
a thin, watery liquid&mdash;the aqueous humor.</p>

<p>The corona ciliaris and orbicularis ciliaris
may be better seen and studied if viewed
through a hand lens.</p>

<h3>THE IRIS</h3>

<p>To see the iris, take hold of the cut edge of
the choroid, and, gently pulling, separate it
from its attachment to the corneo-scleral junction.
The white ring on the anterior surface
of this part of the second coat of the eye is
the ciliary ring. With a scissors, cut around
this ciliary ring at its outer edge. This specimen
will show the anterior surface of the iris,
and on the posterior side it will show the close
relationship between the iris and the ciliary<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
processes. A hand lens will help greatly to
bring out the very interesting fine points.</p>

<h3>THE CORNEA</h3>

<p>After the anterior portion has had everything
removed from it there will be left
nothing but the first coat or tunic of the eye&mdash;the
anterior portion of the sclerotic and
the cornea. The way the cornea seems to fit
into the sclerotic is not quite as one is led to
believe when told that it fits into the sclerotic
much the same way in which a watch crystal
fits into a watch.<a id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Holding this part of the
eye up to a strong light one will see that the
sclerotic seems to overlap the cornea in the
vertical axis.</p>

<p>By using the tweezers the cornea may be split.
Nothing in the way of locating its layers can
be recognized, however, unless a section is
made for microscopic examination. The epithelial
may be scraped off when the cornea is
a trifle dry. This is the ocular epithelium reduced
to a layer of flattened cells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span></p>

<h3>THE CRYSTALLINE LENS</h3>

<p>If the preceding dissections have been done,
the crystalline lens will already have received
some notice. To study the lens properly one
should use an eye that has not been hardened
and also an eye or the lens of an eye that has
been in a 5 per cent. solution of formaldehyde
for about two weeks.</p>

<p>The lens in the unhardened eye will prove
too friable to permit much handling. The dissection
should be made, however, in order to
give opportunity to notice the crystalline clearness
of the lens substance, its great magnifying
power, its attachments, its capsule, etc.
For this purpose it is necessary to proceed
only as in the dissection for the &#8220;hyaloid membrane,
etc.&#8221; That is, use an eye that has been
kept in a cool place for several days, and then
open it, and remove hyaloid, vitreous, and lens
intact, as in the first dissection taken up in
this book. To examine the specimen in detail,
turn it so the lens will be uppermost.
(<a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a>.)</p>

<p>To remove the lens it is necessary to separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
the suspensory ligament, using for this
purpose the small-pointed scissors. The capsule
may be removed by picking it up on the
periphery of the lens, and stripping it off. It
will peel off about the same way that the outer
skin of a bean or pea does.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig18">

<img src="images/illo054.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="320" />

<p class="caption">Fig. 18&mdash;Enlarged to show the processus zonuloe. (<a href="#Page53">Page 53</a>.)</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The tri-radiate lines on the posterior and
the anterior surfaces of the lens will not be
as clearly discernible as in the lens coming
from the hardened eye. Close inspection and
the use of a hand lens will help bring them
out more clearly.</p>

<p>Now, with the point of the scalpel try to
separate the outer layers (cortex) from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
harder inner layers (nucleus). This will
not prove very successful but is suggested for
the purpose of comparison when the same
thing is done to the hardened lens.</p>

<p>It will be found that the lens after having
been in the formaldehyde solution is no longer
crystal like, but more or less translucent.
When viewed from either the anterior side or
the posterior side, the tri-radiate lines on each
surface will be seen to begin at the poles of
the lens and radiate outward toward the lens
equator. Holding the lens up to a strong
light will show that though the lines on either
surface form angles of 120 degrees, the angles
formed by the lines on one side with the lines
on the other side are 60 degrees. On the anterior
surface of the lens the vertical line extends
upward from the pole; on the posterior
surface downward from the pole.</p>

<p>To study the laminated structure of the lens,
it is best to boil the lens. The best way to do
that is to drop the lens from either a hardened
or unhardened eye into boiling water. Let it
boil in the water for about two and a half to<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
three minutes. Longer than that time will
cause the lens to be put out of shape, and make
it so fragile that it can no longer be handled
without having it fall apart. If the lens comes
from an unhardened eye it might be best to
boil it not more than about two minutes.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig19">

<img src="images/illo056.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="310" />

<p class="caption">Fig. 19&mdash;Showing the way the onion-like layers of
the lens may be peeled off.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Insert the point of the scalpel carefully at
one of the poles, and lift gently in the direction
of one of the radiating lines. This will
tend to raise one of the concentric layers,
which can be easily peeled off. Repeat this in
the direction of the other two radiating lines.
Examining, with a hand lens, the exposed surfaces<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
and the layers, as they are taken off,
will show the arrangement of the lens fibres,
and will also show plainly their directions.
(<a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a>.) To get another view of the onion-like
layers of the lens, cut through it with a
safety-razor blade, either longitudinally or
equatorially. (<a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a>.) The better way is to
have enough lenses to make one of each kind.
Never try to work with only one piece of
material. If the lens is first stained with chromic
acid the layers may be seen better, or, a
simpler way is to drop the lens, before cutting
it in two, into a carmine solution; red ink
slightly diluted, will do.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 20&mdash;Section through lens showing

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>A lens that has been boiled and partly dissected<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
may be placed in a 5 per cent. formaldehyde
solution, and kept indefinitely. The lens
fibres, concentric layers, and lens laminae in
such a specimen will always be interesting.</p>

<p>A lens that has lost its transparency because
of hardening in formaldehyde or boiling
may be made clear and nearly transparent
again in the following way: First: Place the
lens in a 50 per cent. alcohol for several hours.
Second: Remove the lens, and let it drain on a
piece of blotting-paper; then place it in a 75
per cent. alcohol. Third: Remove the lens, as
before, then place it in an 85 per cent. alcohol.
The lens may be left in this alcohol from
ten to twelve hours, after which length of time
it should be removed and drained. Fourth:
Place the lens in an absolute alcohol, and leave
it there for ten or twelve hours. Several hours
longer will not injure the lens, nor interfere
with the success of the work. Fifth: Remove
the lens from the absolute alcohol. Place it
upon a piece of blotting-paper, moving it to
another place on the blotting-paper whenever
the paper around the lens seems to have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
up as much moisture as it can hold. Be sure
that the lens has given up nearly all, if not all,
moisture. &#8220;Running through the alcohols,&#8221;
as this process is called, is for the purpose of
dehydrating the tissue. It will be on the side
of safety to let the lens lie exposed on the blotting-paper
for an hour. Sometimes, if the
capsule has not been removed, a small quantity
of alcohol will remain between the lens
and the inner surface of the capsule. This
must be removed. It may be done by either
puncturing the capsule with a pin or needle,
and squeezing out the fluid, or by removing the
capsule entirely. The latter is preferable.</p>

<p>Now drop the lens into xylol. Benzine will
answer, though it will not produce quite so
clear a lens as the xylol does. At the end of
24 or 36 hours the softer cortex will show quite
clear, while the harder nucleus will be still
cloudy. At the end of a week the whole lens,
if it is a small one&mdash;pig, calf, sheep&mdash;will have
become quite clear and transparent; if from a
beef eye it will take longer. It sometimes takes
nearly two weeks. In the case of a boiled lens<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
it will take much longer to clear; it may take
a month.</p>

<p>Cedar oil may also be used for the purpose
of clarifying or &#8220;clearing&#8221; the lens. Harden
in the usual way, run through the alcohols, and
then place in cedar oil. The oil, however, will
stain the lens a yellowish brown, and the lens
will not be as transparent and clear as when
xylol is used.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The longer a lens is left in either of these
two clarifying fluids the harder and smaller it
will become. At the end of a month or six<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
weeks the lens will have become so hard that
it can no longer be cut through with a knife.
If it is desired to halve it, a scroll saw will
be found to be the best thing to use for this
purpose. (<a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>.)</p>

<h2>THE CHOROID</h2>

<p>Select an eye that has had a long part of
the optic nerve left on it and place it into a
5 per cent. solution of formaldehyde. Leave
it in that solution for from two to three
weeks. That period of time in the fluid will
be sufficient to permit the choroid to become
sufficiently toughened and hardened. Leaving
it in the solution longer than that length of
time will not injure the eye in any way.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>After having removed the eye from the
formaldehyde, wash it for a few moments in
running water. This will remove the preserving
and hardening fluid from the surface, and
will save the hands a little from the effects
of the fluid. Next remove all the muscles
and fatty tissues from the sclerotic. After
that has been done, puncture the cornea with
the pointed jaw of the scissors about 2 mm.
from the corneo-scleral junction. (<a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a>.)
Then proceed to cut the cornea away, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
careful not to lacerate the choroid or the
iris. (<a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>.) The escaping aqueous humor
will flow over the eye and make it very slippery,
and, therefore, difficult to hold. Dip the
eye in water, wash it, and then take it out and
thoroughly dry it with a cloth. This procedure
is absolutely necessary, and, if omitted, will
surely result in the dropping of the eye about<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
the time the work on the specimen is nearly
finished. Insert the scalpel between the
peripheral edge of the exposed iris and what
is left of the cornea. With the back edge of
the scalpel, gently loosen the choroid from
the inner side of the corneo-scleral junction to<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
which part it is not securely attached. (<a href="#Fig24">Fig.
24</a>.) This requires only ordinary care, and but
little skill other than that necessary to always
keep the scalpel close to the inner surface of the
sclerotic. When the choroid-iris edge has
been detached from the inner side of the corneo-scleral<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
junction, the weight of the contents
of the second tunic will cause it to sag
and give opportunity to easily separate, with
the back edge of the scalpel, the choroid from
the sclerotic for about a distance of from 8
to 10 mm.</p>

<p>It has been the method in the past to force
water through a blowpipe between the sclerotic
and the choroid, in order to separate the
attachments. It has also been the method to
work under water when wishing to expose or
isolate either the choroid or the retina. It
is unnecessary to do either of these two things.</p>

<p>When the sclerotic has been loosened from
the choroid for about 10 mm. back from its
cut edge around the eye, carefully cut the
loosened part away. (<a href="#Fig25">Fig. 25</a>.) Then loosen
the choroid as far back as to within 1 cm. of
the optic nerve. Cut the separated sclerotic
away. It will be well to state here that during
this dissection the specimen should not be
lifted from the table. Keep the eye resting
on the table all the time, and never lift it by
holding it suspended from the optic nerve.<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
Loosening the choroid from the sclerotic up
to this point is a very easy matter; ordinary
precaution is all that is necessary to prevent
puncturing the choroid with the scalpel, just
be sure to remember to keep the point of the
scalpel close to the sclerotic.</p>

loose from the sclerotic close up to the entrance

<p>To get a perfect specimen and completely
isolated choroid, it must be emptied of its contents.
Insert the scalpel between the lens<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
and the iris, force it on through, and in such
a manner as to keep the scalpel close to the
ciliary processes. (<a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a>.) Cut the vitreous
around the processes. Push the scalpel further
into the vitreous, and cut out the central
part of it, just as one would cut out the core
of an apple. (<a href="#Fig29">Fig. 29</a>.) Remove the scalpel,
pick out the lens and the cut centre of the
vitreous with the broad-point tweezers, holding
the choroid a trifle suspended by the optic
nerve. The remaining part of the vitreous may
be broken down by cutting with the scalpel, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
by squeezing and crushing with the fingers of
both hands. (<a href="#Fig30">Fig. 30</a>.) The choroid will be
tough enough to stand this treatment provided
the pupil is left clear and open to prevent
inter-choroidal pressure. After the vitreous
has been removed the choroid will be left in a
greatly collapsed condition. Dropping it into<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
water and letting it fill up will make it resume
its original shape immediately. The retina
does not always come out with the vitreous.
In such a case, the tweezers may be used to
pick out the retina when the choroid is in a
collapsed condition.</p>

<p>This specimen will show the vena vorticosa,
the ciliary nerves, and their way of ramifying,
and the long ciliary arteries, which run opposite
each other and which may be recognized
by their rather colorless, tubular appearance.
The evacuated choroid makes an excellent
specimen and one easily examined. Place it
in a 3 per cent. solution of formaldehyde, and
then examine with a skiascope, an ophthalmoscope,
or by &#8220;oblique illumination.&#8221;</p>

<p>This dissection is wholly original, and may
be done in about five minutes. The old technique
for doing it required at least an hour
of time with the possibility of procuring one
perfect specimen in every six or seven. The
technique as given here will make it possible
to do the work in not longer than five or six
minutes for the beginner, and about four minutes
for the expert.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span></p>

<h2>THE RETINA</h2>

<p>Isolating the retina from the other tissues
requires considerable patience and dexterity.
When the retina has been removed and placed
in a special receptacle, it will be found
that the specimen is well worth the little
amount of time spent in making it. Previous
techniques, even the writer&#8217;s own, sometimes
took nearly two hours to do, and rarely was
the retina isolated without puncturing or tearing
it; perfect specimens were almost impossible.
The following method will assure one of
success in nearly every instance. Failures are
almost impossible. Punctures, perforations,
tears, etc., are rare. The beginner should
isolate the retina in about six to seven minutes;
the expert in about four and a half to
five minutes.</p>

<p>Select an eye with a long optic nerve, and
prepare it for this dissection by placing it in
a 10 per cent. solution of formaldehyde for<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
about ten to fourteen days, but no longer. If
it is left in the hardening fluid longer than that
length of time, it will interfere with the easy
removal of the vitreous.</p>

<p>The first part of this dissection is the same
as the beginning of the dissection for the
isolation of the choroid. Remove all the outside
tissues first, and then the cornea, and
about 10 mm. of the sclerotic, as described in
the preceding dissection. (See <a href="#Fig22">Figs. 22</a>, <a href="#Fig23">23</a>,
<a href="#Fig24">24</a>, and <a href="#Fig25">25</a>.) That will lay bare the iris and
a few millimetres of the choroid.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>After that has been done, turn the eye so
the iris will be uppermost. With the tweezers
pick up the pupillary margin of the iris, and
with the fine-pointed scissors cut through the
iris and the ciliary processes (<a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>); separate
both from the choroid by cutting close
to the posterior edge of the processes. (<a href="#Fig32">Fig.
32</a>.) In doing that, cut partly through the
vitreous also, but be careful not to injure the
peripheral edge of the retina&mdash;ora serrata.
After the iris has been separated from the
choroid, cut completely through the vitreous<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
in such a way that the lens will also be
removed with the iris. (<a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a>.)</p>

part of the retina (<a href="#Fig34">Fig. 34</a>); blow gently at
first, increasing the pressure until the vitreous
suddenly bulges outward. (<a href="#Fig35">Fig. 35</a>.) If the
iris has been cut away close to the ora serrata,
the vitreous will not only bulge forward, but it
will fall out. If, however, it does not detach
itself at once, insert the scalpel close to the
choroid and with its flat side press downward<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
until a separation occurs. Do not let the
vitreous drop out too suddenly, because it may
tear the retina. Let the vitreous detach itself
slowly by the force of its own weight, though
it will be well to hold some of its weight on the
scalpel. (<a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>.)</p>

<p>After the vitreous has been removed, turn
the eye upward, and by blowing strongly
through the blowpipe at the marginal edge of
the retina, turn the retina upon itself. Repeat
this until the retina lies in a small wrinkled
lump at the &#8220;bottom&#8221; of the posterior part<span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span>
of the eye. (<a href="#Fig37">Fig. 37</a>.) Invert the eye (<a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a>)
and cut away both the choroid and the sclerotic
close to the optic nerve. No care need be
taken in doing this until the scissors come
close to the optic nerve. (<a href="#Fig39">Fig. 39</a>.)</p>

<p>After the choroid and the sclerotic have
been cut away, drop the retina into some<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
water, and it will slowly unfold itself by &#8220;ballooning&#8221;
out into a perfect and beautiful
specimen. (<a href="#Fig40">Fig. 40</a>.) But, if it is desired to
study the specimen closely, it is better to suspend
it in a jar or bottle made of thin glass,
and containing a 5 per cent. solution of formaldehyde.
Remember that the retina is a delicate
membrane in any state; the slightest
rough handling may cause it to be torn, or
otherwise damaged. If the vessel, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
the specimen has been placed and suspended,
has enough preserving fluid to completely fill
it, and it is firmly stoppered, the whole thing
may be inverted, and turned in any direction,
even abruptly, without fear of damaging the
retina. This way of keeping the retina will
give opportunity to inspect and study the
inside as well as the outside of the membrane;
the blood-vessels, and other important parts
easily recognized.</p>

<h2>THE SAGITTAL OR VERTICAL SECTION
OF THE EYE</h2>

<p>Place an eye in a 5 per cent. solution of
formaldehyde for about two weeks. If the eye
is kept in that solution longer than that time,
the lens is apt to become so hard that in cutting
it the capsule and suspensory ligament
will be torn, and the lens will then become
detached; if for a shorter space of time, the
lens and other tissues will be so soft that all
may be so badly torn or lacerated, that a perfect
specimen will not be possible.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that in keeping a
number of eyes together in a vessel for the
purpose of hardening them in the formaldehyde
solution, the corneas of some will be
crushed in. For this dissection, select an eye
that has the cornea in perfect condition.</p>

<p>Remove all the outside tissues with the
scissors, being particular to have the region
immediately surrounding the optic nerve perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span>
clear and clean. If the optic nerve is
longer than 5 mm., cut it off to that length.</p>

<p>To cut the eye in two, use a safety-razor
blade; never a scalpel. The latter is too thick,
too dull, and too clumsy a tool. Begin by cutting
through the optic nerve; dividing it as
nearly as possible into halves. (<a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a>.) Continue
cutting through the sclerotic and all
underlying tissues, stopping at the corneo-scleral
junction, but do not, during this procedure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
even touch the lens. After the eye
has been thus partly separated into, as nearly
as possible, two equal parts, lay it down upon
the cornea, and, holding the razor blade in the
forefingers and thumbs of both hands, cut the
lens in two by forcing the blade down through
it. (<a href="#Fig42">Fig. 42</a>.) Partly open the cut eye to allow
one jaw of the large scissors to enter, turn
the eye over so the cornea will rest on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
jaw, and then cut through the cornea. (<a href="#Fig43">Fig. 43</a>.)</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The two specimens may be kept indefinitely
by placing them in a 3 per cent. formaldehyde
solution. It will be well to remove the lens
from one of the specimens, because it will give
better opportunity to see the anatomical relationships.
Also, these specimens should be
mounted, one above the other, between two
pieces of glass, before placing them in the
receptacle that is to hold them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span></p>

<p>Much can be studied in such specimens.
Moreover, they present to view the various
parts of the organ of vision in such an impressive
way, that one does not soon forget
the wonderful appearance of the construction
of this, Nature&#8217;s perfect camera. (<a href="#Fig44">Fig. 44</a>.)</p>

<p>If another eye is cut into two parts, additional<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
interesting specimens may be procured;
for instance, one showing the presence of the
second coat only, the retina having been torn
out. Another good specimen may be made by
removing all of the inner tissues, and leaving
only the sclerotic and cornea. This specimen
will show that the first coat is almost entirely
a coat which affords strength and protection
to the parts that lie within.</p>

<h2>THE PAPILLA, PUNCTA LACRIMALIA,
AND NASAL DUCT</h2>

<p>The only way to dissect the lacrimal apparatus,
other ocular accessories, and the extrinsic
muscles, is to procure the head of some animal,
preferably a calf&#8217;s head, because of its size.
Any butcher will supply one for from forty
to sixty cents. Have the lower jaw removed.
It will make a less bulky piece of material to
handle.</p>

<p>Close to the inner canthus, on the inner side
of each lid, will be found a little rounded
eminence&mdash;lacrimal papilla&mdash;in the centre of
which is a small opening&mdash;punctum lacrimalis.
Both may be seen better on the lower lid, if
it is pulled down, and on the upper lid, if it
is pulled up.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Be supplied with two knitting-needles. Take
one, lubricate its full length with a little
vaseline, lard, oil, or any other lubricant.
Insert the needle into the punctum of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
lower lid, and push it downward and forward,
aiming to come out in the nose a short distance
from its end. At first it may be a little
difficult to get the needle started; if so, just
wiggle the needle, pushing it at the same time
as directed, until the nasal duct is found. Do
not remove the needle. To insert the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
needle into the punctum of the upper lid is
rather difficult; for that reason the punctum
of the lower lid was chosen, first. Grease the
needle, as was done to the first one, and, with
a little patience and careful manipulation, the
canal opening and its course will soon be
found. The needle may then be pushed
through until it meets the first one. (<a href="#Fig45">Fig. 45</a>.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
From the puncta lacrimalia to the place of
meeting of the two needles, marks the course
of the two canaliculi and their junction before
they merge and form the nasal duct. Leave
the needles where they are, and begin cutting
away the skin. The needles will then mark
the course of each canal and the duct very
plainly. With the small scissors the canals
and the duct may be loosened from the surrounding
tissues. Or, the scalpel may be used
to lay open the canals, cutting along over the
top of the needles. (<a href="#Fig46">Fig. 46</a>.)</p>

<p>The cilia, palpebr&aelig;, palpebral conjunctiva,
ocular conjunctiva, and other superficial ocular
accessories may be examined without dissection.</p>

<h2>MEIBOMIAN GLANDS AND DUCTS</h2>

<p>An examination of the eyelids will show the
openings of the ducts of the meibomian glands
a short distance back of the cilia. Very fine
pins or needles that have been greased may
be easily inserted for a short distance into the
ducts, and then a dissection made along the
course of the duct as outlined by the presence
of the inserted pins or needles. Another way
to see the glands is to slice through the ducts,
with the scalpel or safety-razor blade, the
entire width of either eyelid. This will separate
the glands into two parts and show their
length, breadth and structure.</p>

<h2>ENUCLEATION OF THE ORBITAL
CONTENTS</h2>

<p>The eyes one procures from a butcher or a
slaughter house will always have the extrinsic
tissues so badly cut and torn that identification
of the various parts and their relations is
impossible. Therefore, it is best to supply
one&#8217;s self with the head of an animal, such as
a sheep or a calf, and dissect an eye with all
its extrinsic tissues intact. For this dissection,
a hammer and a chisel are necessary in
addition to the tools needed for doing the
previous dissections.</p>

<p>Using the left orbit, begin the dissection by
making an incision directly over the supra-orbital
ridge, extending from over the inner
to the outer canthus. At the middle of that line,
make an incision, and cut at right angles upward
to the top of the head. Next make a cut
below the eye, extending from the outer to
the inner canthus. (<a href="#Fig47">Fig. 47</a>.) Loosen the
skin<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98-<br />99]<a id="Page99"></a></span>
from the bone with the scalpel, and lay bare
the skull immediately over the orbit. Fold the
flaps of the skin back and fasten them down
to the skull with pins or tacks so they will not
interfere with the work.</p>

<p>Using the hammer and the chisel, cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
through the roof of the orbit at the middle of
the supra-orbital ridge, and continue upward
for about two and one-half inches. Do not
strike hard blows, or the chisel may be driven
through the underlying tissues. Listen for
the peculiar sound that is heard when the
bone has been completely penetrated; then remove
the chisel. Continue until the full distance
of two and one-half inches of bone has<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101-<br />102]<a id="Page102"></a></span>
been separated. (<a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>.) Now, begin at the
upper end, and cut through the bone downward
to the right for about two inches toward the
outer canthus. A similar line should be cut
on the right of the centre line toward the inner
canthus. This will mark out two irregular,
triangular-shaped pieces of bone. (<a href="#Fig49">Fig. 49</a>.)
Remove the piece on the right-hand side by
prying it off. (<a href="#Fig50">Fig. 50</a>.) The left-hand piece
should be pried loose and then carefully cut
away with the scalpel, so that the pulley through<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
which the superior oblique muscle runs its
tendon, will not be injured. In removing the
orbital contents, dissect close to the bone (<a href="#Fig51">Fig.
51</a>), so that the periosteum will also be removed,
and form a sort of sac or capsule in
which will be contained the eye with all its
extrinsic tissues. If difficulty is experienced
in getting at the posterior parts of the orbit,
it will be best to cut away as much more of
the obstructing bone as is necessary. In this
way the &#8220;capsule&#8221; containing the eye, its six<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104-<br />105]<a id="Page105"></a></span>
muscles, the lacrimal gland, and both eyelids,
all <i>in situ</i>, will be removed. (<a href="#Fig54">Fig. 54</a>.) As the
orbital entrance of the optic nerve is neared,
care must be exercised not to cut into this
&#8220;capsule,&#8221; or sever any of the muscles. (<a href="#Fig52">Fig.

<h2>OPHTHALMOSCOPIC EXAMINATION</h2>

<p>By practising on an enucleated eye, one may
gain considerable ability in the use of the
ophthalmoscope, and also learn to recognize
the blood-vessels and other important parts of
the retina. To do this, the eye to be examined
must be very fresh, for only in this condition
will the cornea and lens be sufficiently clear to
permit rays of light to enter the inside of the
eye.</p>

<p>However, since the pupil is oblong in shape,
and often only a narrow slit&mdash;but several
millimetres in diameter&mdash;the field presented
for observation is a rather limited one. To
increase the pupillary aperture, take a pin,
and force the point through the cornea about
three or four millimetres from the corneo-scleral
junction, and at right angles to the
direction of the parallel edges of the pupil.
After the pin has been pushed through until
it has reached to within a short distance (one<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
millimetre) of the edge of the iris, carefully
pick up the iris by raising the pin into a
position perpendicular to the cornea, and force
the pin further down into the eye. The pupil
will have been enlarged on one side. Do the
same thing on the opposite side, and at each
extremity of the pupil. (<a href="#Fig55">Fig. 55</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig55">

<p class="caption">Fig. 55&mdash;Showing one pin before the iris has been picked up
and pulled back, and three pins after the iris has

<p class="caption">Fig. 56&mdash;Showing method of gathering up the extrinsic tissues
in order to get rid of the pucker in the cornea.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>The pupil will now have been made square,
and so large that no difficulty will be experienced
in reflecting either light into the eye, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
in examining the inside of the eye. Care must
be taken not to lacerate the anterior surface
of the lens when the iris is drawn back by
the pins.</p>

<p>Putting the pins into the cornea, and using
them as levers with the point of entrance in
the cornea as a fulcrum, will pucker the cornea
considerably, and a good clear fundus cannot
be obtained. This is easily overcome. Simply
gather up all the tissues surrounding the eye,
force them backward, and hold them firmly
with the fingers of the left hand. (<a href="#Fig56">Fig. 56</a>.)
The right hand is then free to handle the skiascope
or ophthalmoscope, so that the interior
of the eye may be thoroughly examined.</p>

<p>Another way to prepare an eye for ophthalmoscopic
examination is as follows: Go to a
slaughter house and procure a beef eye from
an animal that has been killed but a few minutes
previously. Placing the eye immediately
into an 8 per cent. solution of cocaine and
leaving it there for about an hour will dilate
the pupil to such an extent that work with the
ophthalmoscope will be made very easy. This,<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
as indicated, can be done only with an eye that
is very fresh.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig57">

<img src="images/illo110.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="428" />

<p class="caption">Fig. 57&mdash;Showing window cut in
sclerotic, choroid,
and retina.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Still another way to see the interior is to cut
out a piece of the sclerotic about the size of a
twenty-five-cent piece; then pinch up and tear
out the choroid and the retina under the opening
made in the sclerotic. (<a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>.) Hold the
eye, the cornea forward, close to a bright light,
and the image of the light will be seen upon
the retina. The closer the light is to the eye,
the greater the illumination will be in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
interior of the eye. If the opening or &#8220;window&#8221;
is close enough to the optic nerve, the
optic papilla can be seen easily. And, if care
has been taken to have the opening made midway
between the two branches of the retinal
artery, the entire course may be followed. The
direction of the retinal artery can be determined
by ophthalmoscopic examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span></p>

<h2>THE LACRIMAL DUCTS</h2>

<p>To find the lacrimal ducts, cut across the
outer and inner canthi of the enucleated eye,
pushing the eye forward and the lids backward.
That will expose the conjunctiva of<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
both eyelids and eye, and also show the conjunctival
fornices. On the upper surface
of the palpebral conjunctiva, and near the
outer canthus, will be seen, upon close inspection,
a number of minute openings, usually
eight. These are the openings of the lacrimal
ducts. Pins or straw that have been lubricated
with vaseline, may be inserted and pushed
into these openings for a considerable distance,
and the course of the ducts then can be traced
easily. (<a href="#Fig58">Fig. 58</a>.)</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span></p>

<h2>THE LACRIMAL GLAND</h2>

<p>The lacrimal gland is easily distinguished
by its pink appearance. There are two parts,
inferior and superior. The gland lies directly
over the eye and near the outer angle of the
orbit. In the enucleated eye, it will be found
to lie near the outer canthus and over the
eye. The gland may be easily dissected out
of its position and then examined more closely.
A hand lens will show the racemose construction
of the gland. If the gland is cut in two,
the racemose construction may be seen even
better.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span></p>

<h2>THE CAPSULE OF TENON</h2>

<p>To dissect the capsule of Tenon, it is necessary
to carefully remove the superficial fat
and connective tissue. In text-books and illustrations,
the capsule is usually shown as a
definite sac-like membrane of considerable
thickness, with all its parts well defined. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span>
dissector will soon find that the capsule is not
discerned so easily. It will be found to be the
thin, semi-transparent, fibrous membrane that
surrounds each muscle, as well as the &#8220;posterior
two-thirds of the eye,&#8221; and is continuous
anteriorly with the ocular conjunctiva.
Portions may be pinched up and inflated
through an inserted blow-pipe. This will help
to merely demonstrate its location and parts.

<h2>THE SUPERIOR OBLIQUE MUSCLE AND
ITS PULLEY</h2>

<p>After the lacrimal gland has been dissected
away, a beginning will have been made for cutting
away the fat and the connective tissue.
The first thing to do then is to locate the superior
oblique muscle. Try to keep track of
which part of the eye is the inner side. Having
located the inner side, feel along the top
for a little hard eminence. That is the pulley.
Begin to dissect around the pulley, not through
it, and then follow the muscle along to its
origin; do not separate the muscle from its
origin. When the superior oblique is completely
freed, the action of the muscle may be
readily demonstrated by holding the &#8220;ring&#8221;
or tendinous pulley with the fingers of one
hand, while the muscle is pulled backward and
forward with the other.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span></p>

<h2>THE OTHER EXTRINSIC MUSCLES</h2>

<p>With the dissection of Tenon&#8217;s capsule and
the superior oblique muscle, the work of isolating
the other extrinsic muscles will have
begun. This work needs no directions except<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
a warning to be careful not to injure the pulley
of the superior oblique, and to be careful
not to cut away the inferior oblique. The inferior
oblique will be found to be near the
&#8220;pulley.&#8221; If the dissection is not carried
too close to the origin of the recti muscles, all
the muscles may be kept in place.</p>

<p>If the eye has not been previously subjected
to the hardening influence of formaldehyde, it
may be put into a 5 per cent. solution, and at
the end of ten or twelve hours the muscles
will have become rigid. They can then be better
studied, and may be kept indefinitely.

<h2>THE THREE TUNICS OF THE EYE, THE
HYALOID AND ITS ATTACHMENTS</h2>

<p>This dissection is a rather difficult one to
make, and requires patience.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 61&mdash;Cutting through the iris.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Prepare an eye by placing it in a 5 per
cent. solution of formaldehyde for about ten
days to two weeks. Remove all the outside
tissues. Cut away the cornea, as in the dissection
for the choroid or the retina. Loosen,
as far back as possible, the sclerotic from the
choroid. Remove the sclerotic for about 10
mm. back of the equator of the eye. With the
tweezers pick up the pupillary edge of the iris.
Using the small pointed scissors, cut through<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
the iris. (<a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>.) Lift either one of the cut
edges of the iris, and, with the sharp edge of
the scalpel, gently scrape the <i>processus zonuloe</i>
free from the ciliary processes, cutting
through the ciliary ring as the ciliary processes
are detached from the hyaloid (<i>processus
zonuloe</i>). (<a href="#Fig62">Fig. 62</a>.)</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 62&mdash;Scraping the ciliary processes free. Showing, also,

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>Great care must be taken not to thrust the
point of the scissors into the hyaloid, suspensory
ligament, or vitreous, else the lens may
become detached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span></p>

<p>After the iris with the processes has been
removed, pinch up with the tweezers a fold in
the choroid. Make an incision with the fine-pointed
scissors, and begin removing the choroid
to within about 5 mm. of the cut end of the
sclerotic. (<a href="#Fig63">Fig. 63</a>.) Care must be taken not
to penetrate the underlying retina while making
this part of the dissection.</p>

specimen is preferred without it. Removing
the lens before this time is unwise, because it
acts as a protection to the other tissues while
the specimen is being handled during the dissection.</p>
